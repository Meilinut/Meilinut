Hey, my name is Mohammad. I study AI at Al Zaytoonah University. I'm currently a first-year student with a budding interest in programming and artificial intelligence.

I chose this major because I find AI fascinating and full of potential. Although I am aware of the challenges ahead, I am committed to doing my best and becoming proficient in my field.

On GitHub, you'll find me working on various projects related to AI and programming as I continue to learn and grow. I'm excited to collaborate with others and contribute to the community.
